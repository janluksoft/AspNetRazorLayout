# ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Layout

This project ASP.NET demonstrates how to simple create web pages using the "Razor Pages" framework.

Razor is an ASP.NET programming syntax used to create dynamic web pages with the programming languages. Razor Pages makes use of the C# language for server-side programming, and the Razor templating syntax for embedding C# in HTML mark-up to generate content for browsers dynamically.

The project consists of several cshtml pages. Pages are displayed in the same style by using definitions from the _Layout.cshtml file. The project is created by manually adding folders and files. Creating a sample project adds too many other unnecessary files that obscure the Razor engine.
